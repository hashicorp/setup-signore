## setup-signore

Download and configure the [signore](https://github.com/hashicorp/signore) signing service.

Originally based off of [setup-terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/setup-terraform).

This version of the `setup-signore` Action requires a GitHub personal access token to access GitHub's Releases API and has cross-platform support.

If you only need to install Signore on Linux GitHub Runners, consider using the [setup-signore-package](https://github.com/hashicorp/setup-signore-package) Action,
which does not require any authentication for repositories and Actions in HashiCorp enterprise GitHub organizations.

### Usage

Note: see [action.yml](action.yml) for detailed information about configuration and defaults.

### FAQ

- What Github token do we need?
  - We need to download a signore release from Github, and because the repository is private we need a token that allows access.
- What checksum are we verifying?
  - After downloading the os/arch specific `tar` or `zip` archive that contains the signore binary, we compare its SHA256 hash against the user supplied `archive-checksum`
- How do I get a Github token with access to the signore repo?
  - TBD
- How do I get access to the signore signing service?
